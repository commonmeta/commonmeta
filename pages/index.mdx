# Introduction

Commonmeta is a metadata standard for scholarly metadata. Commonmeta focusses on tools and services, helping them to convert metadata between the various formats. Commonmeta is defined and can be validated with JSON Schema. Supported formats include:

* [BibTeX](https://www.bibtex.com)
* [RIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIS_(file_format))
* [Citeproc JSON](https://citeproc-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/csl-json/markup.html)
* [Crossref](https://gitlab.com/crossref/schema)
* [DataCite](https://schema.datacite.org)
* [Schema.org](https://schema.org)

Commonmeta focusses on general bibliographic metadata, rather than metadata by specific disciplines or subdisciplines.

## Inspiration

Codemeta and Commonmark are important inspirations for Commonmeta, both in name and philosophy. They share these priciples:

  * driven by real-world implementations and not committees
  * features that focus on what is common in existing implementations/formats
  * a testable specification

### Codemeta

[CodeMeta](https://codemeta.org) contributors are creating a minimal metadata schema for science software and code, in JSON and XML. The goal of CodeMeta is to create a concept vocabulary that can be used to standardize the exchange of software metadata across repositories and organizations. CodeMeta started by comparing the software metadata used across multiple repositories, which resulted in the CodeMeta Metadata Crosswalk. That crosswalk was then used to generate a set of software metadata concepts, which were arranged into a JSON-LD context for serialization.
 
### Commonmark

[Commonmark](https://commonmark) is a strongly defined, highly compatible specification of Markdown, along with a suite of comprehensive tests to validate Markdown implementations against this specification.
