    "text": "Commonmeta is a metadata standard for scholarly metadata. Commonmeta focuses on tools and services, helping them to convert metadata between the various formats. Commonmeta is defined and can be validated with JSON Schema. Supported formats include:\nCommonmeta focusses on general bibliographic metadata, rather than metadata for specific disciplines or subdisciplines. BibTex and RIS are widely supported by reference managers, allowing the sharing of metadata for references and reference lists. CSL-JSON is the input format used by the Citation Style Language (CSL) to generate formatted citations in 1000s of citation styles. Crossref and DataCite are DOI registration agencies, enabling the registration of persistent identifiers and associated metadata. Schema.org is a popular schema for structured content on the web (not limited to scholarly resources).\nCommonmeta can and should support additional formats for metadata import and/or export.",

The goal of CodeMeta is to create a concept vocabulary that can be used to standardize the exchange of software metadata across repositories and organizations. CodeMeta started by comparing the software metadata used across multiple repositories, which resulted in the CodeMeta Metadata Crosswalk. That crosswalk was then used to generate a set of software metadata concepts, which were arranged into a JSON-LD context for serialization.\n\n\nCommonmark\nCommonmark is a strongly defined, highly compatible specification of Markdown, along with a suite of comprehensive tests to validate Markdown implementations against this specification.",

    "text": "Serialization formats\nScholarly metadata use several serialization formats. Some formats such as bibtex, ris (defined in the 1980s) and anvl require a dedicated parser, something that should be avoided. xml is mainly used by DOI registration agencies, and parsing is more time-consuming and complex compared to metadata using json. json-ld combines the strengths and weaknesses of xml and json (e.g. namespaces, but also added complexity). yaml (used by cff) is a superset of json and is easier to write for humans, but slower than json and not widely used for network calls, but rather for local files. tomlis an alternative to yaml, but I haven’t seen it used for scholarly metadata.\nIn summary, json is the preferred serialization format for scholarly metadata, and is widely used for that, in particular in REST APIs. xml is mainly used for historical reasons, mainly for DOI registration (although DataCite has depreciated this in favor of JSON).\n\n\nType Safety\nThe scholarly metadata formats take various approaches to what data type (e.g. string vs. integer, or list/array vs. dict/object/hash) they expect for a given field. Some are more flexible, in particular Schema.org JSON-LD, but that flexibility comes at a price in form of parsing overhead and breaking tools. A related issue is the handling of None/null/nil which adds flexibility for optional metadata fields but again adds overhead. Type safety can facilitate metadata parsing and is increasingly adopted in dynamic languages such as Javascript, Python and Ruby, so commonmeta will support it in its JSON Schema.\n\n\nLegacy of Dublin Core\nDublin Core (and the formats heavily innfluenced by it such as datacite and schema.org) have had an important influence on scholarly metadata. Unfortunately some decisions made more than 25 years ago haven’t worked so well, and some of the newer metadata formats have made different decisions. Of course all metadata formats sometimes made decisions that in hindsight didn’t work so well (e.g. date-parts in CSL-JSON or type PostedContent in Crossref), so this is more a sign of the strong influence Dublin Core had on the development of scholarly metadata, and the goal of being generic sometimes making specific things harder.\nOne example is metadata only required for some resource types and therefore not part of Dublin Core, e.g. page numbers, or journal name and issn. This requires complex workarounds or leads to incomplete metadata you see when you for example want to express DataCite DOI metadata in a formatted citation. Another example (which you see predominantly with DataCite) is to lump all related resources together, in this case using relatedIdentifier and relationType, and since 2021 also relatedItem. This makes the easy difficult, in this case listing all the references used in a resource, some of them using a DOI, some of them only having metadata.\n\n\nAuthor Names\nAuthor names is a major topic of complixity in scholarly metadata. Authors can be people or organizations, and for people separate given and family names are needed for some scholarly metadata, e.g bibtex or citations. Metadata from formats that only provide a single name field for authors therefore need to be processed, and this can be tricky (e.g. as the name for a person can be either family, given or given family). Commonmeta (just like Crossref and CSL-JSON) uses givenName and familyName for personal names, name for organizations, and type (which can be either Person or Organization) to distinguish between the two.\n\n\nDates\nDates are another major topic of complexity in scholarly metadata. Scholarly resources can have multiple dates associated with them (e.g. submission_date, acceptance_date and publication_date), and each date can be expressed with different levels of granularity (e.g. year-month-day, year-month, or year). Then there are dates of different granularity (e.g. Summer 2017), approximate dates, and date ranges. Extended Date and Time Format (EDTF) and the underlying ISO8601 is the community standard to cover these various dates and times, but is only partially supported by most metadata standards and tools. crossref and CSL-JSON use date-parts to define partial dates and date ranges.\n\n\nResource Types\nDescribing the type of scholarly resource is important, but unfortunately many vocabularies exist. As they all have their strenghts and weaknesses and no existing vocabulary handles all resource types encountered in commonmeta, commometa is building an internal vocabulary to support as many mappings as possible.\n\n\nVersioning\nVersioning has historically not been much of an issue with text publications, where at most we had a handful of versions that could be sorted chronologically and one current version. With datasets and software this was always different with easily hundreds of versions that sometimes have a complex relationship to each other. This kind of versioning is best described by hasVersion and isVersionOf relationships, and more work is needed for commonmeta to address this. This topic is also relevant for preprints, where preprint and journal article are published in different places and the relationship is not generated automatically.\n\n\nCollections and Parts\nAgain a topic historically not much of an issue with text publications. Besides the obvious: books can have chapters (possibly with different authors), and journals have issues which in turn have articles. Again this topic is much more complicated with datasets or software, where the decision for how to split up the data or code is almost arbitrary. Something commonmeta needs to support.",

    "text": "Reference Managers\nReference managers are tools that help building a database of the relevant literature for a researcher or student, and for inserting citations and the bibliography into a manuscript. Import and export of these references is important, and BibTex and RIS are the most commonly used file formats. Reference management increasingly is happening in an online environment, sometimes requiring different file formats or additional information, e.g. all recent publications by a specific author or specific institution. Commonmeta can help to facilitate this.\n\n\nFormatted Citations\nCitation Style Language (CSL) is the standard Open Source framework for generating formatted citations and bibliographies, with over 10,000 citation styles supported and integrations into many tools and services. CSL uses its own metadata format (CSL-JSON), so metadata in other formats first have to be converted. Because of its focus on formatted citations, CSL-JSON lacks support for some features commonly found in scholarly metadata, e.g. persistent identifiers for people and organizations, or funding information.\nThe other big issue with formatted citations is that they don’t work very well as input format (because of the large number of available citation styles, DOIs not included in many citation styles, and citation styles typically not indicating the content type such as dataset). This is a huge problem with journal manuscripts submitted via manuscript submission systems. The two common workarounds – requiring a specific citation style, and turning the formatted citations back into structured metadata using lots of human and/or compute resources – are not good solutions. The simplest solution is to include identifiers in the formatted citation, prefereably a DOI or other persistent identifier, or alternatively a URL. Commonmeta-based tools and can help in this workflow.\n\n\nDOI Content Negotiation\nMany scholarly resources (more than 150 million) use DOIs as persistent identifiers. These DOIs have standardized metadata, at least per DOI Registration Agency (Crossref, DataCite, etc.). DOI Content Negotiation is a standard mechanism to obtain these metadata in a variety of formats, and Commonmeta can help simplify this format conversion.\n\n\nSoftware Metadata\nMetadata for software can be expressed in a variety of formats, including the emerging new formats codemeta and cff. Commonmeta can help simplify metadata conversions for software, e.g. to more generic formats like bibtex or as formatted citation.",
